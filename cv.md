## Brief information about yourself

My name is Roman and I am 26 years old. My main specialty is a cook, pastry chef. I have been working in this area for about 9 years.

This profession has helped me develop skills such as:

- ability to work in stressful situations

- keep many processes under control in parallel.

Due to the war in my country, I have not been working for 3 months and decided to dedicate this time to my studies. Because learning is always necessary, regardless of the situation. I want to learn how to program in order to change my current profession.
